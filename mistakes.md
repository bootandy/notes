## Mistakes:
#### Read docs on new API before using
* Could have saved money with the google maps & places API 
  
#### Units in names
* No: timeout
* Yes: [timeout_seconds](https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2022/03/20/please-put-units-in-names)
        
 
## Things to do better
* When asked when & why 'x':
  * Search the git history, search PR history
 
* Writing docs:
  * Imagine counter argument then search for it. Include links.
